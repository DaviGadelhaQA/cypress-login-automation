# Login Flow - Cypress Automation Project

## 📖 Overview

This project was created to practice and evolve end-to-end test automation using Cypress, focusing on the login flow of a web application.

The main goal is to demonstrate the progressive improvement of automation practices, starting from a basic implementation with hardcoded data and evolving to a more scalable and maintainable structure using custom commands and Page Object Model (POM).

In addition to automated tests, a manual test case sheet was created to complement the quality process and document scenarios, validations, and edge cases.
